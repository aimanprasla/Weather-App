To run this app on your local machine you must first have a WeatherMap API KEY. You can get a free one on their website. Enter it into the App.js file into the API_KEY variable or create an env and do what I have done.
A deployed version of this app can be found at https://weather-gy5dpus6i-aiman-praslas-projects.vercel.app/
This app was created with npx create-react-app
The app uses the WeatherMap API, specifically the 16 day daily forecast, geocoding API, and reverse geocoding api.
